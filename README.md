This is a project submission for NTU CCDS TechFest Hackathon.

## 1. Introduction
FACTER is an innovative platform designed to empower users in assessing the credibility of news articles and social media posts efficiently. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and community-driven engagement features, our solution provides a comprehensive approach to combating misinformation in real time.

## 2. Project Overview
FACTER allows users to input links from external sources for verification. The system follows a structured process to analyze and validate the credibility of the content:
- If the link has been previously analyzed, users are redirected to the existing verification page, ensuring quick access to up-to-date credibility scores and verification details.
- If the link is new, the system extracts key content, compares it with verified news sources in real time, and generates a credibility score. A new verification page is created and continuously updated as new information becomes available.

This approach ensures that users always receive accurate and evolving credibility assessments based on real-time news monitoring.

## 3. Community Engagement: The ‘Community Notes’ Feature
A key differentiator of FACTER is its Community Notes feature, which fosters collaborative fact-checking:
- Registered users can contribute fact-checking notes on articles.
- Submitted notes undergo a review process before being displayed to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Users can upvote notes they find credible and useful. Highly upvoted notes are displayed more prominently, guiding readers toward the most trusted information.
To maintain platform integrity, users must create accounts to contribute to community activities. Additionally, security measures are in place to assist users in recovering lost accounts safely.


## 4. Technology Stack & Implementation
FACTER integrates multiple technologies to ensure a seamless and robust verification process:
- Real-Time Data Fetching – Utilizes news APIs for up-to-date news analysis.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Analyzes and compares content against verified sources.
- Database Management – Stores verification reports and community interactions for long-term reference.
- Continuous Monitoring System – Ensures verification statuses are updated dynamically as new information emerges.

## 5. Conclusion
By combining automated verification processes with community-driven fact-checking, FACTER provides users with a trusted and reliable tool to navigate today’s complex digital information landscape. Our platform ensures that fact-checking remains efficient, transparent, and continuously updated, empowering users to make well-informed decisions.
